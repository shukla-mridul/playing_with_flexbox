        <h1>DUCKS - A MARVELOUS Species!</h1>
        <p>Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller
            and shorter-necke. Divided among several subfamilies. Ducks are mostly
            aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.</p>

            <h2>5 Facts about ducks!</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Ducks are well adapted for water, land, and air activities.</h3>
                    <p>These gifted swimmers have waterproof feathers, which have a waxy coating that protects an inner
                        layer of down, to keep them warm and dry. They can swim in cold water without catching a chill
                        because their feet have blood vessels that are close together so they don’t lose heat. Some duck
                        species can dive up to 240 feet below the water, and others can fly as high as 21,000 feet in
                        the
                        air (although most migrate at heights of 200 to 4,000 feet). They can also fly long distances,
                        and
                        they use wind to help them reach speeds of up to 60 mph.</p>

                    <h3>Ducklings are loving siblings and communicate with each other before hatching.</h3>
                    <p>Ducklings coordinate hatching by communicating with each other while they’re still in their eggs.
                        Hatching at the same time is important, because sticking together as a group helps protect them
                        from
                        predators. After hatching, they swim and walk together, following close behind their mothers.
                        Even
                        as adults, ducks prefer to be in a group, which brings us to our next fact …</p>

                    <h3>They are super-social animals!</h3>
                    <p>Ducks are most comfortable when living with other ducks in their natural environment. When on the
                        water, they congregate in groups called “paddlings,” which helps protect them from predators. In
                        these groups, they are free to spend their days foraging for food and sleeping soundly, knowing
                        their friends will warn them of any danger.</p>

                    <h3>Ducks have regional accents.</h3>
                    <p>Regional accents are just another example of ducks’ ability to adapt to their environment.
                        Middlesex
                        University researcher Dr. Victoria de Rijke recorded the sounds of ducks in the heart of London
                        and
                        compared them with those of ducks living in the countryside. She found that the ducks in London
                        had
                        a louder, rougher quack, because they had to shout above the noise of city life. The ducks in
                        the
                        country “made longer and more relaxed sounds.” Dr. de Rijke even noted how similar their sounds
                        were
                        to those of humans living in the same area.</p>

                    <h3>Ducks have better vision than you do.</h3>
                    <p>The shape of duck's eyes allows them to see things near and far simultaneously and in sharp
                        focus.
                        And since their eyes are located on either side of their head, they are able to see almost 340
                        degrees around. They can also move each eye independently and sleep with one eye open to watch
                        for
                        predators. In a group, ducks will trade off keeping an eye open to help protect the rest of the
                        group from danger while they sleep.</p>
